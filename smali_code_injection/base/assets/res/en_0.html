<p align='justify'>Perhaps you just learned that you are pregnant? Your baby may not
even seem real yet. However the choices you make and what you eat
now and every day you are pregnant or breastfeeding can affect your
health and the health of your baby.</p>
<p>It is your choice:
<li>	what you eat</li>
<li>	whether you drink alcohol and/or smoke</li>
<li>	how much your weight may change</li>
<li>	how often you see your doctor</li>

Pregnancy is a very important period. It is a time to think about your
lifestyle, habits and diet and how they affect you and your future child.
It is a time to consider if you wish to adopt healthy habits that will be
beneficial to you and your baby both now and in the future.

It is never too late to make the right choices.
When you are expecting a baby or breastfeeding a baby, nutritious
food is very important for both of you:
</p>
<p align='justify'>
<b>For You:</b> pregnancy and lactation place extra demands on your body.
To meet these demands you need to think about what is best to eat and
drink. Good nutrition in pregnancy helps you to stay healthy and
energetic and to prepare yourself for taking care of you, your new
baby and the rest of the family.
</p>
<p align='justify'>
<b>For Your Baby:</b> through your milk your baby eats everything you eat.
Thus, the best way of giving your baby a healthy diet is for you to eat a
healthy diet.
