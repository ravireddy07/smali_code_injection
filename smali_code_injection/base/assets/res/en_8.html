<p><b>1. Morning sickness</b></p>
<p align='justify'>About 70% of women suffer from sickness, usually in early pregnancy
- around week 9-10. Later, by the end of the 4th month of pregnancy,
symptoms usually disappear or become much milder. To relieve the
symptoms of sickness, try to:</p>
<li>eat small but frequent meals (with about 2 hr intervals)</li>
<li>avoid smells and foods that make your sickness worse</li>
<li>eat more nutritious carbohydrate foods: try dry toasts or
crackers, breakfast cereals, fruits and vegetable salads at any
time during the day</li>
<li>eat less fatty and sugary foods</li>
<p><b>2. Constipation</b></p>
<p align='justify'>35-40% of pregnant women suffer from constipation during
pregnancy.</p>
<p>How to deal with the problem:</p>

<li>drink plenty of fluid such as plain water (6-8 cups a day)</li>
<li> increase intake of foods rich in fiber (wholemeal bread, brown
rice, wholegrain cereals, fresh and dried vegetables and fruits,
especially prunes and figs)</li>
<p align='justify'>
Remember, iron supplements can sometimes cause or aggravate the
symptoms of constipation. If you are taking iron supplements and
notice that the symptoms of constipation progress, consult your doctor.</p>

<p>3. Heartburn</p>
<p align='justify'>May occur anytime during pregnancy, but symptoms usually get worse
at the end of pregnancy. Also a common problem - about 30-50% of
pregnant women suffer from heartburn.</p>
<p>Some suggestions on how to deal with the problem:</p>

<li> avoid chocolate, fatty foods, alcohol and mint, especially
before bedtime - they tend to relax oesophageal muscle so that
acid from the stomach regurgitates up into the oesophagus
more easily</li>
<li> avoid acidic and spicy foods that may irritate mucosa (tomato,
citrus fruits and juices, vinegar, hot pepper, etc.)</li>
<li> milk and dairy products can temporarily relieve the symptoms
of heartburn</li>
<li> eat slowly, drink fluids between meals rather than with meals</li>
<li>eat small frequent meals, do not eat large meals before
bedtime</li>
<li> sleep well propped up, not lying flat</li>

Remember to consult your doctor before taking antacid medications.
Some antacids can bind iron in foods and make iron unavailable for you
to absorb.</p>
