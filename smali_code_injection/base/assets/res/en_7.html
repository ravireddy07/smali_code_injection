<p align='justify'>On average you should expect to gain 10-12,5 kg by the end of your
pregnancy.</p>
<p align='justify'>
Starting with the 4th month of your pregnancy you will probably gain
around 1,5-2 kg per month. Check your weight periodically and consult the
doctor if you notice you are gaining less than 1 kg or more than 3 kg per
month.</p>
<p align='justify'>
Both too little and too much weight gain can adversely affect the
health of you and your baby. Thus, make sure that you and your baby
get enough calories, but do not overeat (especially sweets and fatty
foods). Remember, “eating for two” does not mean “twice as much”.
Just follow your appetite and the healthy eating advice in this booklet.
Avoid excess under- or overeating.</p>
<p align='justify'>
If your weight before pregnancy was substantially lower or higher
than normal, ask your doctor for specialized advice on diet and
weight gain.</p>
<p align='justify'>
Remember, during your pregnancy is not a good time to go on a diet in an attempt to lose weight!
