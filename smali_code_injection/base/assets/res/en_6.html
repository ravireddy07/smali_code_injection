<p><b>1. Alcohol</b></p>
<p align='justify'>Try not to drink alcohol during pregnancy. An occasional glass of wine
at special events is OK.</p>
<p align='justify'>
Alcohol crosses placenta and can lead to physical, growth and mental
problems in some babies. It is especially important not to drink alcohol
at the time of conception and during the first 3 months of pregnancy
when the embryo is most vulnerable to the toxic effects of alcohol.</p>
<p><b>2. Smoking</b></p>
<p align='justify'>Try not to smoke during pregnancy or at least try to reduce smoking
substantially. Mothers who are heavy smokers are at much higher risk
of having low birth weight babies. Smoking can also be a cause of
premature birth, miscarriage and stillbirth and may impair your childâ€™s
growth and development.</p>
<p align='justify'>Remember: it is never too late to stop or at least reduce smoking or
drinking. Your baby will benefit from each alcoholic drink or cigarette
you give up!</p>
<p><b>3. Caffeine</b></p>
<p align='justify'>Effects of caffeine on the foetus are not well established yet. Tea,
cocoa and cola -type drinks contain about the same amount of caffeine
while coffee contains about twice as much caffeine. Try to limit your coffee intake to 3-4 cups a day.</p>
<p align='justify'>
Remember also, that tea and coffee tend to impair your ability to
absorb iron from foods, such as beans and cereals, and iron
supplements.</p>
<p><b>4. Medications</b></p>
<p align='justify'>Many medications can adversely affect your baby and are contraindicated
for pregnant women or women who are breastfeeding.
Consult your doctor before taking any medications, including aspirin
and vitamin supplements.</p>
