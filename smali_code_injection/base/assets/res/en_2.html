<p align='justify'>Contrary to a sometimes often quoted saying, you do not have to “eat
for two” - or double the amount of food you normally eat.</p>
<p align='justify'>From about the 3rd month of pregnancy you need ONLY an extra 200-
300 kcal per day in addition to the diet you ate before you became
pregnant. This small extra amount can be achieved, by eating for
example 2-3 slices of bread extra (or 1 glass of milk and 1-2 slices of
bread extra) per day.</p>
<p align='justify'>
A healthy diet is one that is based mainly on plant foods. Therefore it is
important to eat lots of vegetables, fruits, bread, potatoes, pasta,
cereals, beans and lentils accompanied by only relatively small amounts
of: low fat milk, cheeses, kefir and yogurts; fish, lean red meats, and
poultry. Whenever possible try to get locally grown vegetables and
fruits, especially when they are in season. These can be less
expensive, more nutrient dense, fresh and safe from contamination.</p>

The following explanation highlights the relative importance of different
foods by placing them into 5 food groups.</p>
