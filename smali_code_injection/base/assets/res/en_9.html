<p align='justify'>Breastfeeding can be a wonderful experience both for you and your
baby.</p>
<p><b>Remember:</b></p>
<li> breast milk is by far the best food for your newborn baby; no
commercial-made baby formula as well as any other food or drink
can match breast milk;</li>
<li>breastfeeding (as compared to artificial feeding) protects against
common infections, especially diarrhoeal and respiratory diseases as
well as urinary tract and ear infections;</li>
<li>breastfeed as often as baby wants, do not restrict frequency of
feeding according to a timetable;</li>
<li>let the baby come off the breast spontaneously, do not take baby off
the breast before the baby is finished;</li>
<li>try to breastfeed exclusively for 6 months and then continue for as
long and often as possible (exclusively means giving your baby
only breastmilk for 6 months – no other fluids, including water,
tea or glucose!);</li>
<li>anaemia is not a contra-indication to breastfeeding and even if
you are anaemic you should continue to breast feed;</li>
<li>weight loss is not a contra-indication to breastfeeding and even
if you have lost weight you should continue to breast feed;</li>
<li>you should not stop breastfeeding even if you are smoking or
occasionally consume alcohol – your milk is still the best food
for your baby.</li>
