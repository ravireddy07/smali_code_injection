<p align='justify'>After birth you will probably be about 3-4 kg over your pre-pregnant
weight. Don’t try to lose weight immediately – since these stores are
used to make breast milk. Breast milk production itself demands a lot
of energy - so breastfeeding will help you to get back to a normal
weight.The principles of healthy nutrition recommended for pregnancy apply
also during breastfeeding.</p>
<p>Remember:</p>
<li>alcohol can pass into the breast milk, so do not drink or at least
restrict alcohol intake during lactation;</li>
<li>there is no evidence of any beneficial effect of alcohol on
breast milk production;</li>
<li>smoking may decrease your ability to produce breast milk and
thus affect the growth of your baby, smoking also decreases
the vitamin C content in breast milk;</li>
<li>try not to harm the lungs of your newborn child - never smoke
in baby’s room;</li>
<li>caffeine can pass into the breast milk and cause hyperactivity
and sleeping problems in your baby - try not to drink too much
coffee, tea and cola drinks (recommendations are the same as
for pregnancy);</li>
<li>many medications can also pass into breast milk - check with
your doctor before taking any (however, taking most
medications is not a contraindication to a breastfeeding)</li>
